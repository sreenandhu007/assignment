            <p>The Kawasaki Ninja H2R is a track-only variant of the Ninja H2. It is the fastest and most powerful production motorcycle on the market, producing a maximum of 310 horsepower (230 kW) and 326 horsepower (243 kW) with ram-air. The H2R has 50% more power than the fastest street-legal motorcycles. It features a tubular, thin-wall steel trellis frame and a single-sided swingarm, with a traditional sportsbike wheelbase of 1,450 mm (57 in). The front fairing of the Ninja H2R incorporates winglets made of carbon fiber, which may be aerodynamic devices designed to create a low-pressure zone to help move cooling air through the engine bay, to produce downforce at high speed, or to provide straight-line stability in a short-wheelbase sportsbike chassis. The H2R has a top speed of approximately 220 mph (354 km/h). It has electronic rider aids including an anti-lock braking system (ABS), Kawasaki Traction Control (KTRC), Kawasaki Engine Brake Control (KEBC), a Kawasaki Quick Shifter (KQS), an electronic steering damper (ESD), and Kawasaki Launch Control Mode (KLCM). The H2R was announced by Kawasaki in a late-2014 teaser campaign and was widely expected to be fully revealed at the Intermot motorcycle trade show the same year. It was finally revealed at the EICMA trade show in November. The bike was shown for the first time in North America at the AIMExpo show at Orlando, Florida in October, 2014.</p>
